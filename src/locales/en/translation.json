      "title": "What's Dijkstra?",
      "desc": "Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later."

      "title": "Why was this page created?",
      "desc": "It's created to showcase the power of the Dijkstra algorithm through a visually interactive graphical interface. This university project page offers a user-friendly platform for understanding and exploring the algorithm's functionality. With intuitive controls and captivating visualizations, users can input their own graphs, select source and destination nodes, and witness the algorithm dynamically calculate the shortest path. This page provides an engaging and educational experience focused on the Dijkstra algorithm."
